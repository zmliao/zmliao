I am a PhD student in joint program from SJTU and Shanghai AI lab. 

My research interest includes **HPC** applied in **Computer Graphics**, with a particular focus on rendering, reconstruction and simulation. My goal is to empower agents to learn the physical world.

I was a member of the UESTC_404 team, participating in the ICPC and CCPC competition series.
