I am a PhD student in joint program from SJTU and Shanghai AI lab. 

My research interest includes **HPC** applied in **Computer Graphics**, with a particular focus on GPU acceleration for rendering, reconstruction and simulation. My goal is to make my contribution to understanding and creating the physical world, not the imagined world from LLMs and AIGCs.

I was a member of the UESTC_404 team, participating in the ICPC and CCPC competition series.
